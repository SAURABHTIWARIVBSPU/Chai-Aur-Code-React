This repository is a collection of my notes, projects, and resources as I learn React.js with Chai Aur Code. It's a place where I can track my progress and share my journey with others.

## ⚛️ Why React.js?

React.js is a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It's widely used in modern web development due to its flexibility, efficiency, and strong community support. Learning React.js will help me create dynamic, responsive web applications and expand my skillset as a frontend developer.
